careModelTitle: "Direct-to-consumer virtual weight loss clinic"
description: >
  This care model supports a high-efficiency virtual weight loss clinic. Although it supports workflows to obtain prior authorization for medications, the payment model for clinical services is direct-to-consumer. The model supports an evidence-based stepwise approach of screening for co-morbidities, supporting lifestyle modifications, and prescribing GLP-1s when appropriate.
