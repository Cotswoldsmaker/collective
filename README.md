# Collective

Welcome to the Canvas collective! This repository is dedicated to sharing protocols and care models as part of the Canvas server-side SDK. 

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find the following structure:

- **Protocols Folder**: This folder contains various protocols, implemented as Python files. Each protocol serves as a building block for our server-side operations.

- **Care Models Folder**: Here, each care model is represented as a YAML file. A care model is essentially a collection of protocols, structured to provide comprehensive care solutions.

## Disclaimer

Please note that Canvas does not guarantee the clinical or technical accuracy of any protocols provided in this repository. All protocols and care models are intended as a reference and should be thoroughly evaluated and approved by your healthcare professionals or technical teams before being used in patient care settings. Usage of these protocols without proper validation and approval is at your own risk.

## Getting Started

To get started with our SDK and understand how to implement these protocols and care models, please refer to our [SDK Quickstart Documentation](https://docs.canvasmedical.com/sdk/sdk-quickstart/).
